.TH EDAC-CTL 8 "@META_DATE@" "@META_ALIAS@" "EDAC admin utility"

.SH NAME
edac-ctl \- EDAC admin utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B edac-ctl 
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBedac-ctl\fR program is a \fBperl\fR(1) script which performs
some useful administration tasks for EDAC (Error Detection and Correction)
drivers. 

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "--help"
Display a brief usage message.
.TP
.BI "--mainboard"
Print mainboard vendor and model for this hardware, if available.
This option requires that the \fBdmidecode\fR(8) utility be installed,
and must be run as root.
.TP
.BI "--status"
Print the status of EDAC drivers (loaded or unloaded).
.TP
.BI "--register-labels"
Register motherboard DIMM labels into EDAC driver sysfs files.
This option uses the detected mainboard manufacturer and model
number in combination with a "labels database" found in any
of the files under /etc/edac/labels.d/* or in the labels.db file
at /etc/edac/labels.db. An entry for the current hardware must
exist in the labels database for this option to do anything.
.TP
.BI "--print-labels"
Display the configured labels for the current hardware, as
well as the current labels registered with EDAC. 
.TP
.BI "--labeldb="DB
Specify an alternate location for the labels database.
