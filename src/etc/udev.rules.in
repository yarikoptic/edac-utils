#  Load edac labels once an edac mdule is registered.
# 
#  We really should key off the *last* udev event, instead of what perhaps
#   is the first, but triggering on the module is the only sane way
#   I can see to do it at this time. Hopefully, all sysfs labels files
#   will be created by the time edac-ctl starts trying to write labels.
#   (extra delay before writing labels is added expressly for this  purpose)
